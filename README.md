# Memory
A game for memorization, using ChatGPT generated questions
This game was made in a morning in preperation for school, hopefully to train
quick memorization facts. The odds of me adding more features are pretty slim though

# Play
You can either download the release binaries or you can download the repository and open
the project.godot in Godot, a free and open source game editor available at https://godotengine.org/download

# Plan
 - Make it harder to accidentally click the question too late and mistakenly click the next questions answer
 - Potentially add 3 seconds to read the question, Kahoot style
